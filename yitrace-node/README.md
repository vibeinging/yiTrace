# @yitrace/db

Embedded yiTrace database for Node.js and Electron.

## Install

```bash
npm install @yitrace/db
```

`@yitrace/db` is the JavaScript entry package. Native binaries are published as
optional per-platform packages such as `@yitrace/db-darwin-arm64` and
`@yitrace/db-linux-x64-gnu`, so users only download the binary for their
platform.

Supported targets for the first npm release:

- macOS x64 / arm64
- Linux x64 / arm64 with glibc
- Windows x64 with MSVC

For AgenticData or another internal consumer that needs a stable install source
before the public npm release, build immutable tarballs and lock those exact
files in the consumer repo:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm run release:artifacts
npm run release:prepublish
npm run pack:verify  # runs pack:local first
```

This writes `@yitrace/db` plus any locally available platform packages to
`yitrace-node/dist/*.tgz`. `pack:local` appends a commit label such as
`g1a2b3c4d5e6f` to each tarball name and writes `dist/pack-manifest.json` with
the exact files. Set `YITRACE_PACK_LABEL=<release-id>` when the consuming repo
needs a human-chosen immutable label. Put those tarballs in the consuming repo
or an internal package registry, then depend on exact `file:` tarballs:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@yitrace/db": "file:vendor/yitrace-db-0.0.1-g1a2b3c4d5e6f.tgz",
    "@yitrace/db-darwin-x64": "file:vendor/yitrace-db-darwin-x64-0.0.1-g1a2b3c4d5e6f.tgz"
  }
}
```

Do not keep overwriting a shared `yitrace-db-0.0.1.tgz`. If the payload changes,
the filename or registry version must change too, so lockfiles and rollbacks can
identify the exact native binary.

For a registry publish, publish platform packages first and the root package
last. Do not publish a root package that contains only the current machine's
native binary.

Current platform policy:

- AgenticData server builds stay on one native architecture at a time. The
  current server baseline is x64: Node, DuckDB, yiTrace native, and sqlite native
  must all be x64.
- Do not mix an arm64 yiTrace native package with x64 DuckDB/sqlite, or the
  inverse. If AgenticData switches the server to arm64, first move DuckDB and
  sqlite to arm64 too, or adopt the same per-platform optional package strategy
  for those dependencies.
- AgenticData local development may still use macOS arm64 artifacts
  (`@yitrace/db` root tarball + `@yitrace/db-darwin-arm64` tarball), but that is
  not the server architecture decision.
- Local tarballs may also include any other native packages already present on
  the build machine, such as macOS x64.
- Public npm / CI release target set remains macOS x64/arm64, Linux x64/arm64
  glibc, and Windows x64 MSVC. Those platform packages must be produced by CI
  or matching build machines before publishing the root package.

## Usage

ESM:

```ts
import { YiTraceDB, createSpanEventBuilder } from "@yitrace/db";

const db = await YiTraceDB.open({ dataDir: "./data", tenantId: 1 });

const builder = createSpanEventBuilder({
  traceId: "run-uuid",
  sessionId: "session-uuid",
  attrs: {
    project_id: "agentic-data",
    skill: "review",
    mode: "auto",
    call_site: "worker.ts:10",
  },
});

builder.startSpan({
  spanId: "span-uuid",
  name: "risk review",
  agentName: "risk-agent",
  toolName: "card-risk",
  model: "gpt-5",
  inputText: "疑似盗刷订单",
});
builder.log({ spanId: "span-uuid", message: "疑似盗刷" });
builder.endSpan({
  spanId: "span-uuid",
  status: 0,
  durationNs: 12_000_000,
  outputText: "建议人工复核",
});

await builder.ingest(db);

const hits = await db.search({
  text: "盗刷",
  k: 10,
  filter: {
    attrs: {
      project_id: "agentic-data",
      skill: "review",
      mode: "auto",
      call_site: "worker.ts:10",
    },
  },
});
const trace = await db.trace("run-uuid");
const span = await db.span("run-uuid", "span-uuid");
const logMessages = span?.logEvents?.flatMap((event) => event.messages) ?? [];
const traces = await db.traces();

const page = await db.traceSearch({
  filter: { projectId: "agentic-data", skill: "review", toolName: "card-risk" },
  limit: 10,
});
console.log(page.readPlan?.source, page.readPlan?.candidateSpanKeys);

await db.close();
```

`traceSearch` / `traceAggregate` / `storageStats` / `traceTrajectories` / `trajectoryGroups` /
`loops` / `loop` / `taskTraces` return `readPlan`. `source: "filter_index"` means the query
first used the attrs sidecar postings to narrow span keys. Postings are memory-budgeted:
very wide values or total-entry pressure disable only the affected postings, then queries
fall back to the sidecar rows and still return correct results. Persistent data dirs write a
disposable `filter_attrs.dat` segment cache and reopen recovery loads it before replaying the
WAL tail. `source: "scan"` means it fell back to a full folded scan, for example when the
filter only contains `text` or unknown attrs.
`traceAggregate` can also return `source: "aggregate_rollup"` for no-text aggregate queries;
persistent data dirs write a `trace_rollup.dat` segment cache, and reopen recovery loads it before
replaying the WAL tail. The cache is disposable: deletes, retention apply, segment upgrades, stale
versions, or corrupt cache contents rebuild it from the current snapshot.
Trajectory, loop, and task helpers can return `source: "trajectory_rollup"` for no-text path
summaries and reuse the same `trace_rollup.dat` cache after reopen. When those helpers expand
complete traces after finding candidates, `readPlan.traceFetchSource` shows whether that second
step also used the rollup by trace id. Text filters still use the normal folded read path.

Direct event ingest is still supported when you already have wire events:

```ts
await db.ingest([
  {
    trace_id: "run-uuid",
    span_id: "span-uuid",
    ts: 1,
    seq: 1,
    event_type: 2,
    ext_span_id: "span-uuid",
    logs: ["疑似盗刷"],
    attrs: {
      external_run_id: "run-uuid",
      project_id: "agentic-data",
      skill: "review",
      mode: "auto",
      call_site: "worker.ts:10",
    },
  },
]);
```

CommonJS:

```js
const { YiTraceDB, createSpanEventBuilder } = require("@yitrace/db");
```

This package does not read yiTrace files directly. It embeds the Rust engine in
the Node process through Node-API, so WAL recovery, manifest snapshots, folding,
tenant filtering, BM25, and vector search still run through the database engine.
Internally it calls yiTrace's `EngineJsonApi` in-process; it does not start an
HTTP server, bind a port, or send traffic through a TCP socket.

For Electron, open the database from the main process and expose narrow IPC
methods to renderers. Do not let multiple app processes open the same `dataDir`
for writing; yiTrace creates a `.yitrace.lock` file to enforce a single writer.

For Node servers, the same rule applies. A single process may hold one
`YiTraceDB` handle and serve many concurrent requests through that handle. Do
not run `cluster`, PM2, or multiple containers where every worker opens the same
`dataDir`. If the app needs multiple workers, run one yiTrace server process or
one owner process for `YiTraceDB`, then have workers send trace data over HTTP
or IPC. The embedded package deliberately fails fast on the second writer
instead of pretending to be a multi-process database.

String IDs are supported for direct `db.ingest()`. yiTrace keeps an internal
stable `u64` hash for indexing and stores the original values in
`external_trace_id`, `external_span_id`, `external_parent_span_id`, and
`external_session_id`. You can query with either numeric IDs or the original
string IDs. `attrs` is persisted through the engine and returned as JSON on
search, trace, and span detail responses.

Trace and span detail responses also return raw `logEvents`, so applications do
not need to mirror log lines into `attrs.event_logs`. Each event keeps its
`ts`, `seq`, `eventType`, stable `eventId`, `messages`, and event-level
`attrs`:

```ts
const span = await db.span("run-uuid", "tool-call-1");
for (const event of span?.logEvents ?? []) {
  console.log(event.seq, event.messages);
}
```

The event builder hides `seq`, `event_type`, start/end event pairing, and
`ext_span_id`. It emits the same wire format as direct `db.ingest()`, so callers
can inspect `builder.events()` before sending or call `builder.ingest(db)` to
flush the batch.

`SpanEvent` explicitly supports the commonly consumed fields:
`duration_ns`, `tool_name`, `model`, `input_text`, and `output_text`, plus token
counts, status, logs, tenant, external IDs, and `attrs`.

Search supports exact attrs filters for the high-cardinality dimensions used by
AgenticData trace pages:

```ts
await db.search({
  text: "盗刷",
  filter: {
    project_id: "agentic-data",
    skill: "review",
    mode: "auto",
    call_site: "worker.ts:10",
  },
});
```

The equivalent nested form is `filter.attrs.{project_id,skill,mode,call_site}`.
Values are exact matches after JSON normalization. Strings remain strings,
numbers remain JSON numbers, booleans remain booleans, `null` remains null, and
arrays/objects round-trip as JSON arrays/objects in `attrs` on search, trace,
and span detail responses. Filtering is guaranteed for the high-frequency read
model fields: `project_id`, `skill`, `mode`, `call_site`, `task_fingerprint`,
`loop_id`, `harness_version`, `schema_fingerprint`, `intent_signature`,
`validation_status`, `review_status`, `eval_status`, `path_memory_id`,
`stop_reason`, `phase`, and `validator`. Other attrs are stored and returned,
but do not have a dedicated index contract yet.

Session listing also accepts the same attrs filter shape:

```ts
await db.sessions({
  attrs: { project_id: "agentic-data", skill: "review", mode: "auto" },
});
```

The session filter returns a session when at least one span in that session
matches all supplied attrs, then returns the complete session aggregate.

Single-node read models are exposed as thin wrappers over the same in-process
engine API:

```ts
const trajectories = await db.traceTrajectories({
  filter: { projectId: "agentic-data", taskFingerprint: "refund-v1" },
});
const groups = await db.trajectoryGroups({
  filter: { projectId: "agentic-data", taskFingerprint: "refund-v1" },
});
const diff = await db.traceDiff("run-a", "run-b");
const loops = await db.loops({ projectId: "agentic-data", taskFingerprint: "refund-v1" });
const loop = await db.loop("loop-refund");
const taskRuns = await db.taskTraces("refund-v1", { validationStatus: "pass" });
```

These APIs use the in-memory filter index for the common filtering step. No-text
path summaries reuse the span rollup cache; materialized disk indexes dedicated
to trajectory, loop, and task views are a later performance upgrade.

Annotation and dataset association are stored in the embedded metadata ledger.
They do not copy trace payloads and do not change the trace/WAL/segment format:

```ts
const annotation = await db.annotate({
  traceId: "run-a",
  spanId: "span-a",
  label: "best_path",
  score: 950,
  source: "human",
  attrs: { project_id: "agentic-data", skill: "review" },
});

await db.updateAnnotation(annotation.annotationId, {
  status: "resolved",
  reviewer: "qa",
});

await db.linkDatasetItem({
  datasetId: "agentic-regression",
  itemId: "case-1",
  traceId: "run-a",
  spanId: "span-a",
  split: "eval",
  label: "pass",
});

const annotations = await db.annotations({ projectId: "agentic-data", includeDeleted: true });
const datasetLinks = await db.datasetAssociations({ datasetId: "agentic-regression" });
```

Retention uses the same metadata ledger for audit and policy records. It is
explicit: call `retentionPlan()` first, then `applyRetention()` when the plan is
acceptable. Hot traces still in the WAL tail are skipped. Audit and policy
queries use the same in-memory metadata postings as annotations.

```ts
const plan = await db.retentionPlan({
  filter: { projectId: "agentic-data" },
  deleteBeforeTs: 100000,
  protect: { annotations: true, datasetAssociations: true },
});

const result = await db.applyRetention({
  filter: { projectId: "agentic-data" },
  deleteBeforeTs: 100000,
  requestedBy: "nightly-retention",
});

const audits = await db.retentionAudits({ source: "nightly-retention" });
```

`OpenOptions.readOnly` is intentionally not exposed yet. Passing `readOnly`
throws at runtime so applications do not accidentally assume a true read-only
open while the engine still uses the writable durable path.

## Electron Packaging

Package the native `.node` binary outside Electron's `asar` archive. For
electron-builder, keep the platform package and unpack native files:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "asarUnpack": [
      "**/*.node",
      "node_modules/@yitrace/db*/**/*"
    ]
  }
}
```

Do not tree-shake or prune `@yitrace/db-*` optional platform packages from the
main-process bundle. The JavaScript loader resolves the matching optional
package at runtime. If your bundler copies native files to a custom location,
set `NAPI_RS_NATIVE_LIBRARY_PATH` to the unpacked `.node` file before importing
`@yitrace/db`:

```js
process.env.NAPI_RS_NATIVE_LIBRARY_PATH = require("path").join(
  process.resourcesPath,
  "native",
  "yitrace-db.darwin-arm64.node",
);
```

Open `YiTraceDB` only from Electron's main process and expose specific IPC
methods such as `search`, `trace`, and `span` to renderers.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

`npm run build` produces a local `yitrace-db.<platform>.node` file for the
current Node platform. That file is intentionally ignored by git. Set
`NAPI_TARGET=aarch64-apple-darwin` or another Rust target triple when you need
to override local target detection.

From the repository root, also run the package-mode eval when changing the Node
package or cross-language package contracts:

```bash
./scripts/package_mode_eval.sh
```

That eval builds and tests `@yitrace/db` together with the Python, Rust, and
TypeScript package surfaces, so package drift is caught in one place.

## Publishing

Do not publish a root package that only contains the local machine's `.node`
file. Public npm releases must use the optional platform-package layout.

Release flow:

```bash
npm ci
npm run npm:dirs

# Run once per target in CI. Example:
npm run build:release -- --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

# After all .node artifacts have been collected under ./artifacts:
npm run release:artifacts
npm run release:prepublish  # metadata only; this script skips automatic optional package publish
npm run pack:check
npm run pack:verify         # write commit-labeled tarballs and verify them in a clean consumer
```

Then publish each platform package first, followed by the root package:

```bash
npm publish npm/darwin-x64 --access public
npm publish npm/darwin-arm64 --access public
npm publish npm/linux-x64-gnu --access public
npm publish npm/linux-arm64-gnu --access public
npm publish npm/win32-x64-msvc --access public
npm publish --access public
```

The root `@yitrace/db` package declares those platform packages as
`optionalDependencies`. npm skips incompatible OS/CPU packages during install,
and `native.js` loads the matching binary at runtime.
