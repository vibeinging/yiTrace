# yiTrace

**A local TraceDB for agentic engineering.**

Agentic engineering needs more than prompts, logs, and chat memory. You need to
see the real path an agent took: prompts, tool calls, spans, errors, tokens,
model outputs, and the step that worked. yiTrace stores that path in a local
TraceDB so you can search it, replay it, turn it into eval data, and feed useful
execution history back into Agent Memory.

## Why

Building agents is not just prompt engineering. It is engineering a system that
can call tools, recover from failures, compare runs, and improve over time.

The missing layer is execution memory: not just what the user said, but what
the agent actually did. yiTrace gives you that layer locally:

- replay multi-turn, tool-heavy agent runs
- search prompts, logs, tool calls, errors, and model outputs
- filter by tenant, agent, status, time, and custom attrs
- track token and cost by trace, session, and agent
- collect failed or useful spans into eval datasets
- reuse successful run paths as evidence for Agent Memory

## Quick Start

Choose the install path that matches your app.

### Python

Use this when your Python or FastAPI app wants local trace search without
running a separate yiTrace service.

```bash
python -m pip install yitrace yitrace-db
```

```python
from yitrace import DbExporter, Tracer, connect

with connect(path="./yitrace-data", tenant_id=1) as db:
    tracer = Tracer(exporter=DbExporter(db, tenant_id=1), node_id=1)

    with tracer.trace("risk review", tenant_id=1) as trace:
        with trace.span("LLM check") as span:
            span.log("疑似盗刷")
            span.set_tokens(input_tokens=900, output_tokens=120)

    tracer.close()

    hits = db.search({"text": "盗刷", "k": 10})
    print(hits)
```

If you only want to send traces to a running yiTrace server, install just the
SDK:

```bash
python -m pip install yitrace
```

```python
from yitrace import HttpExporter, Tracer

tracer = Tracer(
    exporter=HttpExporter("http://127.0.0.1:7878/v1/ingest", tenant_id=1),
    node_id=1,
)

with tracer.trace("risk review", tenant_id=1) as trace:
    with trace.span("tool call") as span:
        span.log("query risk database")

tracer.close()
```

### Node / Electron

Use `@yitrace/db` when a Node backend or Electron main process needs local
trace storage and search. It embeds the Rust engine through Node-API; it does
not parse database files in JavaScript.

```bash
npm install @yitrace/db
```

```ts
import { YiTraceDB, createSpanEventBuilder } from "@yitrace/db";

const db = await YiTraceDB.open({ dataDir: "./yitrace-data", tenantId: 1 });

const events = createSpanEventBuilder({
  traceId: "run-uuid",
  sessionId: "session-uuid",
  attrs: {
    project_id: "agentic-data",
    skill: "review",
    mode: "auto",
    call_site: "worker.ts:10",
  },
});

events.startSpan({ spanId: "span-uuid", name: "risk review", agentName: "risk-agent" });
events.log({ spanId: "span-uuid", message: "possible card fraud" });
events.endSpan({ spanId: "span-uuid", status: 0, durationNs: 12_000_000 });

await events.ingest(db);

const hits = await db.search({
  text: "fraud",
  k: 10,
  filter: { attrs: { project_id: "agentic-data", skill: "review" } },
});

console.log(hits);
await db.close();
```

If your TypeScript app only emits traces to a server, use the lighter SDK:

```bash
npm install @yitrace/trace-sdk
```

```ts
import { HttpExporter, Tracer } from "@yitrace/trace-sdk";

const tracer = new Tracer(
  new HttpExporter({ url: "http://127.0.0.1:7878/v1/ingest", tenantId: 1 }),
  1,
);

tracer.trace("risk review", (trace) => {
  trace.span("tool call", (span) => {
    span.log("query risk database");
  });
}, undefined, 1);

await tracer.close();
```

### Run a local yiTrace server

Use server mode when multiple app processes or machines should write to one
TraceDB.

```bash
python -m pip install "yitrace-db[server]"
yitrace-db serve --data-dir ./yitrace-data --bind 127.0.0.1:7878
```

Then search over HTTP:

```bash
curl -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:7878/v1/search \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Tenant-Id: 1' \
  -d '{"text":"盗刷","k":10}'
```

The full HTTP contract is in [API Reference](docs/API_REFERENCE.md).

## Which Package Should I Install?

| App shape | Install | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Python app writes and searches local traces | `pip install yitrace yitrace-db` | Embedded DB in the Python process |
| Python app only sends traces to a server | `pip install yitrace` | Lightweight tracing SDK |
| FastAPI app wants a yiTrace route/server | `pip install "yitrace-db[server]"` | Embedded DB plus optional FastAPI/Uvicorn server |
| Node backend or Electron app writes and searches local traces | `npm install @yitrace/db` | Embedded DB through Node-API |
| TypeScript app only sends traces to a server | `npm install @yitrace/trace-sdk` | Lightweight tracing SDK |
| Existing OTel/OpenInference app | Send `POST /v1/traces` | OTLP/OpenInference compatible ingest |
| Rust app | Source dependency | Rust SDK and embedded wrapper live in this repo |

Current public versions:

- npm: `@yitrace/db@0.1.2`, `@yitrace/trace-sdk@0.1.2`
- PyPI: `yitrace==0.1.2`, `yitrace-db==0.1.2`

## Embedded Mode vs Server Mode

**Embedded mode** opens a local data directory inside your app process:

```python
db = connect(path="./yitrace-data", tenant_id=1)
```

```ts
const db = await YiTraceDB.open({ dataDir: "./yitrace-data", tenantId: 1 });
```

Use it when one machine owns the data directory. Multiple local worker
processes on the same machine are supported; yiTrace serializes open/write
paths with data-dir locks and uses reader pins for snapshot cleanup.

**Server mode** runs one yiTrace process and lets clients write over HTTP:

```bash
yitrace-db serve --data-dir ./yitrace-data --bind 0.0.0.0:7878
```

Use it for multiple machines, containers on different hosts, or any unreliable
network filesystem. Do not share one embedded data directory across machines.

## Console

yiTrace includes a replay console. If you install from packages, run the Python
server and open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7878/
```

From source, build the React console once and copy it into the engine crate:

```bash
cd yitrace-console
npm install
VITE_API=http npm run build
rm -rf ../yitrace-engine/crates/yt-engine/console_dist
cp -r dist ../yitrace-engine/crates/yt-engine/console_dist
```

The console uses the same `/v1/*` JSON API as any custom UI.

## Build From Source

Use this path when you are changing the engine, console, or package wrappers.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vibeinging/yiTrace.git
cd yiTrace

cd yitrace-engine
cargo test --offline
cargo run -p yt-engine --example server
```

The Rust engine core is intentionally std-only. Heavy integrations live in
separate crates or package directories.

Package-level checks:

```bash
# Python SDK
cd yitrace-sdk/python
python -m pytest

# TypeScript SDK
cd yitrace-sdk/typescript
npm install
npm test
npm run build

# Node embedded DB
cd yitrace-node
npm install
npm run build
npm test

# Python embedded DB
cd yitrace-db-python
python -m pytest
```

Release artifact build:

```bash
./scripts/package_release_artifacts.sh
```

The GitHub Actions package workflow runs only on `v*` tag pushes. Use
`vX.Y.Z-only-python-sdk` style tags to test one package target; use `vX.Y.Z`
tags for the full package matrix.

## How It Works

```text
SDKs / OTLP / embedded package
    |
    v
EngineJsonApi or HTTP ingest
    |
    v
WAL + memtable --flush--> immutable segments
    |                         |
    v                         v
BM25 / vector / attrs indexes read-time fold
    |                         |
    +---------- search / replay / cost / eval
```

The key idea is simple: yiTrace stores events, not mutable spans. A span is
written as start, log, end, and late attribute events. Reads fold those events
into a complete span. Event identity is deterministic:

```text
event_id = hash(ext_span_id, seq, event_type)
```

That makes retries and crash replay safe: the same event is counted once.

## Available Today

yiTrace is built for teams doing agentic engineering: debugging real runs,
building eval loops, inspecting tool behavior, and keeping execution history
private and searchable.
